        <h5>How to open a Payment Account</h5>
        <p>Opening a Payment Account with Salve is a secure and fully online process, designed to balance thorough compliance with user-friendly accessibility. The onboarding consists of two steps, involving Know Your Customer (KYC) verification and Due Diligence, conducted by our expert Risk & Compliance team.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="flex-step">
        <div class="flex-box-left">
            <h4>Step 1: Initial Application & Primary KYC</h4>
            <p>Start by completing the onboarding questionnaire at onboarding.salve.sm. This form collects basic information about your enterprise.</p>
            <p>
            • Once submitted, our team will immediately begin preliminary KYC screening.
            </p>
            <p>
            • You will create temporary login credentials (username and password) to access the onboarding platform and track your application status at any time.
            </p>
            <p>
            • This step typically takes less than one business day. If clarification is needed, the platform will indicate what is missing or requires correction. Our team may also contact you directly, if necessary.
            </p>
            <p>If approved, you’ll automatically proceed to Step 2.</p>
        </div>
          <div class="flex-box-mid">
            <h4>Step 2: Extended Due Diligence</h4>
            <p>
                In this stage, you'll be asked to provide more detailed business documentation, <span style="font-weight: bold;">particularly related to your company’s key persons and financial profile.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                • Required documents may be submitted through the platform as attachments.
            </p>
            <p>
                • Like Step 1, you can check the real-time status of your onboarding progress at any time using your temporary credentials.
            </p>
          </div>
        <div class="flex-box-right">
            <h4>Final Approval & Account Activation</h4>
            <p>
                Once both stages are approved:
            </p>
            <p>
                • You’ll receive your <span style="font-weight: bold;">Client ID</span> and be contacted by our team to help determine the most suitable <span style="font-weight: bold;">membership level</span> for your business.
            </p>
            <p>
                • After mutual agreement and signing of the membership contract, your <span style="font-weight: bold;">Payment Account</span> will be opened and a <span style="font-weight: bold;">dedicated IBAN</span> will be issued.
            </p>
            <p>
                • You will also receive step-by-step guidance on how to activate and use your online banking environment.
            </p>
            <p>
                At this stage, your <span style="font-weight: bold;">temporary onboarding credentials</span> will be deactivated, and you’ll create your <span style="font-weight: bold;">final secure login</span> to access and manage your account via Browser or Mobile App.
            </p>
